 A proof of concept tool to show my understanding of similar tools such as dirb and gobuster. It could be faster with multithreaded implementation and precise wordlists. I have included a popular wordlist commonly bundled with similar tools. You can configure the target, the port and what list you want to use. It will scan recursivly, 


## Prerequisites
 * Python3 (sudo apt-get install python3)
 * pip (sudo apt install python3-pip)
 * Requests (python3 -m pip install -U requests)
 

 ## Notice: 
 There are times when the script may fail, it makes use of both the YGODeck & Discord API services and such is at the mercy of their uptime. Rerun as needed.
 
 
 ## To-Do: 
 * Extensionless file support
 * Argument support for configuration
 * Non-recursive support


 ## Built With:

 * [Python3](https://docs.python.org/3.6/) - The Language Used
