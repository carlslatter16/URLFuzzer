## Educational Purposes Only! #
 A poc tool to show my understanding of similar tools such as dirb and gobuster. It could be faster with multithreaded implementation and precise wordlists. I have included a popular wordlist commonly bundled with similar tools. You can configure the target, the port and list you want to use. It will scan recursivly. There is an option for verbosity if you want to see what is going on, along with some diagnostics at the end


## Prerequisites
 * Python3 (sudo apt-get install python3)
 * pip (sudo apt install python3-pip)

 ## Notice: 
 There are times when the script may fail, it makes use of both the YGODeck & Discord API services and such is at the mercy of their uptime. Rerun as needed.
 
 
 ## To-Do: 
 * Extensionless file support
